# SearchBlox Remake

This is a **remake** of the original SearchBlox — a popular Roblox extension used to find which server a specific player is in.  
Unlike the old version, **this project is 100% safe, transparent, and has no backdoors of any kind.**

## ✅ About this project

The original SearchBlox was taken down from the Chrome Web Store due to malicious code that put users' accounts at risk.  
**This remake has none of that.** It's been rebuilt from scratch with a focus on safety, privacy, and real functionality.
and the best thing! it's open-source and it's unobfuscated.

🚫 **No backdoors**  
🔐 **No data stealing**  
🛠️ **Still needs a few tweaks**

## 💡 How to use the extension

1. Download the extension ZIP.
2. Extract it to a folder.
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
5. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the folder.
6. Done! You can now use the SearchBlox Remake safely.
